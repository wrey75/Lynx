'genkeymap.pl' will generate java classes for handling your keyboard, 
which has not been supported on WeirdX yet.

Step 1. Try to find working X server, which has been connected target keyboard.

Step 2. On this X server, try 
        $ xmodmap -pk -pm | ./genkeymap.pl -n foo
        You will get Keymap_foo.java and Keymodifier_foo.java in
        the current directory. Of course, substitute 'foo' with 
        your favorite name.

Step 3. Copy those files to ./com/jcraft/weirdx/ directory.

Step 4. Compile them and run WeirdX with a property 'weirdx.display.keymap'
        as 'foo'.
