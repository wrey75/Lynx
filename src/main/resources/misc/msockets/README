This directory contains 'de.linuxtest.msockets' package and
a patch file for JDxpc.

The 'de.linuxtest.msockets' package is a library for thread communication
behaving like ordinary Java sockets. This package was written by
Marcus Schiesser(info@linuxtest.de) and his motivation for hacking this work
was to solve the problem that WeirdX and JDxpc applets could not work without
digital signing. Thanks to this package, WeirdX and JDxpc can communicate
without local TCP sockets, which are forbidden by JVM security system.

ymnk wrote a patch 'jdxpc-0.0.6-msockets.patch' for JDxpc,
but first patch is little bit ugly and ymnk has hesitated to apply it to 
formal tree. If you have comments/suggestions, please write ymnk@jcraft.com

If you are interested in this hack, try apply above patche to
jdxpc-0.0.6 and add following lines,

weirdx.jdxpc=yes
weirdx.jdxpc.socket=de.linuxtest.msockets.MemorySocket
weirdx.displaysocket=de.linuxtest.msockets.MemoryServerSocket
.
