Description
===========
LynX is a pure Java implementation (basically JAVA6) based on
the GPL project WeirdX available at http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/

LynX as a superset of WeirdX
============================
WeirdX is the codebase of LynX. The goal of the two projects
are sighlty different. LynX is a basic new windows manager
like GNOME or KDE. The basic idea behind LynX is to provide
a fresh and pluggable graphical environment using the JAVA
graphic environment.

The features we want to have in this project:
  - Having a full stack for a GUI environment
  - Providing a X-compatible interface capable to run X-Window
    programs.
  - Proving a new lightweight protocol for applications to
    ease the coding of graphical application giving the
    description of the window rather than a complete 
    fixed graphical implementation.
  - Giving integrated systems (like full-text search as a plug
  	system): like Spotlight on MacOS.
  - Giving an integrated trash system for files running in LynX
  	rather than driven by the application itself.

WeirdX is a pure Java X Window System server under GNU GPL. It is 
implemented with JDK 6 & Swing APIs, so it will run on several 
platforms. WeirdX handles X window protocol directly,
so any proxy programs are not needed on X client side.

LynxX is derived from WeirdX which is derived from WiredX/JXPie, 
which are also pure Java X Window
System server. WiredX is a pure Java X server for Java2 and
JXPie is for PersonalJavaTM.
