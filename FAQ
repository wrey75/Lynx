Introduction:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1.1 What is WeirdX? 
----------------------------------
WeirdX is a pure JavaTM X Window System server.
WeirdX handles X window protocol directly,
so any proxy programs are not needed on X client side.
WeirdX had originated from an early version of WiredX-Lite. 

1.2 Where can I get WeirdX? 
----------------------------------
The official site to get new developmental versions is
http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/ . 

1.3 Why it is named "WeirdX"?
----------------------------------
That name has come from the development cycle of authors.
First of all, X clients had be executed on WeirdX at random.
Then, if 'weird' behaviors had been observed, 
they had started dull bug hunting procedures, dumping X protocol
sequences, interpreting them by eye balls,
checking spec-docs of X protocols, etc,.
If bugs had been identified and they had been fixed, 
fixed code had been feed-backed to the source tree.
These cycles has been repeated tons of times.
You may find weird behaviors in current version.
Some of them are forgiven to be fixed, because of poor functionalities
of Java 1.1.* APIs.

1.4 What X protocols are supported?
----------------------------------
At present, only X Core protocol is supported partially.
In the core protocol, some requests are given up to be
implemented. For example, the request "WarpPointer" is not
supported. Do you know how to move a mouse pointer by Java APIs?

1.5 How about the relation between WeirdX and WiredX?
-----------------------------------------------------
WiredX is a pure Java X server and it is a flagship of JCraft,Inc.
JCraft has developed WiredX since April/1998 and continued to make best efforts
for improving it day by day. WeirdX is also a pure Java X server
and it was ramified from the snapshot(March/1999) of WiredX. 
Since that ramification, WeirdX has been improved by ymnk in his spare time and
he will continue to improve it, because we believe GPL'ed pure Java X server is
useful for open source community. 
As you know, WeirdX is under GPL and on the other hand WiredX is not
free software, to our regret. Of course, contributions from contributers
to WeirdX must never be merged to WiredX.

2.1 What are required to use WeirdX?
You need JDK 1.1.*(in some case, Swing 1.1.*) or Java2.
And of course, you must have a unix box, on which X clients run. 
If you want to run WeirdX as an applet,
you need Java plug-in, JRE 1.1.2 or Java2 and
web browsers: Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.
Don't use Java2 plug-in on Opera. Opera will crash.

2.2 What platforms are supported?
Ideally, WeirdX will be available on any platform, which supports
JDK 1.1.* and Swing 1.1.*. Confirmed platforms are listed below.

5.1 How about SSH?
Of course, WeirdX will work with SSH.
Here, the feedback from James B. Davis(james.davis@pobox.com) is
quated.
  "I've got FSecure ssh on my WinNT laptop with weirdX 1.0.7.
   When I set displaynum to 0, a remote client via a ssh session comes
   right up."
Joseph S. Berrios(jberrios@cise.ufl.edu) has reported us that
a free ssh client for Windows is available at
  http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html
