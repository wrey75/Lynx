Introduction:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1.1 What is LynX? 
----------------------------------
LynX is a pure JavaTM X Window System server.
LynX handles X window protocol directly,
so any proxy programs are not needed on X client side.
LynX had forked from a version of WiredX (2004). 

1.2 Where can I get LynX? 
----------------------------------
The official site to get new developmental versions is
http://www.gibhub.com/wrey75/lynx/ 

1.3 Why it is named "LynX"?
----------------------------------
That name comes from "Linux" and "X" at the end to refer
to the X-System Window. It is also a reference to
the names of animals given by Apple to their MacOS X
operating systems as LynX could be seen as a replacement of
the graphical interface used in MacOS (basically it is 
a window manager). 

1.4 What X protocols are supported?
----------------------------------
At present, only X Core protocol is supported partially.
In the core protocol, some requests are given up to be
implemented. For example, the request "WarpPointer" is not
supported. Do you know how to move a mouse pointer by Java APIs?

1.5 How about the relation between WeirdX and LynX?
-----------------------------------------------------
WiredX is a pure Java X server and it is a flagship of JCraft,Inc.
JCraft has developed WiredX since April/1998 and continued to make best efforts
for improving it day by day. WeirdX is also a pure Java X server
and it was ramified from the snapshot(March/1999) of WiredX. 
Since that ramification, WeirdX has been improved by ymnk in his spare time and
he will continue to improve it, because we believe GPL'ed pure Java X server is
useful for open source community. 
As you know, WeirdX is under GPL and on the other hand WiredX is not
free software, to our regret. Of course, contributions from contributers
to WeirdX must never be merged to WiredX.

LynX is a fork of the WeirdX project as this project seems dead
since 2004.

Installation:

2.1 What are required to use LynX?
You need JRE 5 (the Java Runtime Environment).
And of course, you must have a unix box, on which X clients run. 
If you want to run LynX as an applet,
you need Java plug-in, JRE 5 and
web browsers. Currently, this behavior is NOT supported.


2.2 What platforms are supported?
Ideally, LynX will be available on any platform, which supports
JRE 5.

5.1 How about SSH?
Of course, WeirdX will work with SSH.
Here, the feedback from James B. Davis(james.davis@pobox.com) is
quated.
  "I've got FSecure ssh on my WinNT laptop with weirdX 1.0.7.
   When I set displaynum to 0, a remote client via a ssh session comes
   right up."
Joseph S. Berrios(jberrios@cise.ufl.edu) has reported us that
a free ssh client for Windows is available at
  http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html
