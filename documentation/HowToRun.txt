The server should be run withe the following parameters:

Main-Class: com.jcraft.weirdx.WeirdX
JVM Parameters: 
  -Dweirdx.displaynum=6
  
This will enable the server to run as the 6th display.

Note the clients (xterm and so on) must be configured with
an environment variable named DISPLAY set accordingly:

export DISPLAY=:6

or, if you don't run the client on the same machine than the server:

export DISPLAY=<host>:6

On a MacOS Snow Leopard or above, it is necessary to avoid the use
of the default X11 application. You simply have to start the server
and then the testing application.

On MacOS, the simplest application is xterm. But you have in the
directory /usr/X11/bin all the stuff to use X11.
