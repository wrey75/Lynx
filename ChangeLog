Last modified: Thu Apr 15 08:27:09 UTC 2004

Changes since version 1.0.31:
............................
- added the secure X access support by using JSch.
- fixed a crash bug in setting the title of window frame in RootlessWM mode.
- fixed crash bugs in handling window properties.
- fixed bugs in displaying Japanese characters on recent J2SE's VM.
	
	
Changes since version 1.0.30:
............................
- modified to be free from 'misc/msocket/weirdx-*.*.*-msockets.patch' and
  deleted 'misc/msocket/weirdx-1.0.26-msockets.patch'.
- fixed a problem in using CapsLock key pointed out by Hans Wolff.
- fixed a crash bug in RootlessWM window mode pointed out by 
  Roland Mainz(Roland.Mainz at informatik dot med dot uni-giessen dot de).

	
Changes since version 1.0.29:
............................
- modified to merge patches from Steve Holland, who has developed WeirdMind.
- added the interface com.jcraft.weirdx.DisplaySocket.
Many thanks to Steve Holland. Above changes have not been done without him.
- added ad-hock hacks for displaying box characters, which are assigned code
  from 0x0b to 0x19 in iso8859-1 character sets.
- fixed a bug in changing window properties.
- fixed incompleteness in copying GC(graphics context).
- fixed bugs in getting/adding Selection.
- fixed a bug in switching the input focus for key events, which were
  pointed out by Matt Ittigson.

	
Changes since version 1.0.28:
............................
- improved to support the resize operations in 'RootlessWM' mode.
- improved to support the close button on the title bar in 'RootlessWM' mode.
  In the previous version, the close button did not work for some X
  clients, which did not support 'WM_DELETE_WINDOW' protocol.
- fixed a bug in typing '_' on MacOSX.
  This fixing was not done in the previous version crelessly.

	
Changes since version 1.0.27:
............................
- renamed the window mode 'MultiWindow' as 'Rootless'.
  In this mode, you have to run an X window manager.	 
- added the window mode 'RootlessWM'.
  In this mode, WeirdX will work as in the 'MultiWindow' mode of
  WeirdX 1.0.26; title bars will be attached to window frames.
- improved to support the 'RootlessWM' mode.
  * The close button on the title bar will work correctly.
  * The name of window will be displayed on the title bar.	 
  * The tile bar will not be attached to pop-up menu and pop-up window.
  * The input focus will be handled.
- modified the root window to be invisible in the 'Rootless' and
  'RootlessWM' mode.
- fixed a bug in typing '_' on MacOSX.

	
Changes since version 1.0.26:
............................
- fixed a bug in processing the 'ImageText8' request,
  which was reported by Shin-ichi MORITA(s-morita at beingcorp dot co dot jp).
- added README.XDMCP written by Valentin Pavlov(v_valchev at prosyst dot bg).
- improved the multi-window mode support. 
  If a window manager is running in multi-window mode,
  title bars will not be attached to window frames by the native window system.
  By this improvement, some weird behaviors of previous versions in
  multi-window mode will be worked around. Anyway, for enjoying this hack,
  exec WeirdX in multi-window mode and run a x window manager;twm, wmaker,
  sawfish, etc. then x clients.
	
	
Changes since version 1.0.25:
............................
- fixed bugs in processing the 'CopyArea' request.
  For example, this fixing will fix weird behaviors on
  'gnome-help-browser', 'kdehelp'.
- added the support for the 'jp106' keyborad.
- added a WindowAdapter to shutdown WeirdX by pressing a close button,
  which is attached to WeirdX's root-window by the native window system.
- added the experimental close button support in the multi-window mode.

	
Changes since version 1.0.24:
............................
- fixed bugs in searching scalable fonts.
  Now, by this fixing, 'kpanel' will work on WeirdX. Try 'startkde'!
- modified some code related to the XDMCP support for running WeirdX 
  on the built-in JVM of IE

	
Changes since version 1.0.23:
............................
- fixed bugs in communications between WeirdX and X clients.
  WeirdX is a multi-threaded X server and, in the current implementation,
  each one of X clients accepts events and replies from several threads.
  Until this fixing, any exclusive lock had not been cared in the communications.
  By this bug fix, the frequency of random freezes has been decreased.	 
- fixed a bug in precessing the ListProperties request.
  The error recovery code had been missing.

	
Changes since version 1.0.22:
............................
- fixed a bug, which was sneaked into GetImage request handling code
  since version 1.0.15. For example, 'gimp' has not been able to handle
  font glyph correctly.
- added some XLFDs for proportional fonts, which make you happy in
  using 'gimp'.
- added 'MemorySocket' hack, which solves the problem in using WeirdX and
  JDxpc applets. This hack is contributed from Marcus Schiesser.
  Check 'misc/msockets' directory

	
Changes since version 1.0.21:
............................
- reviced the drawing operations, drawing of thick lines (linewidth > 1) and
  thick rectangles. This hack was done by Christian Werner
- added the friendly interface for invoking JDxpc.
  JDxpc 0.0.6 or higher is requried. This hack was done by Marcus Schiesser.
- fixed bugs in invoking EnterNotifcation/LeaveNotication events.
  They had caused weird behaviors on Tk widgets.

	
Changes since version 1.0.20:
............................
- added the support for the dxpc(Differential X Protocol Compressor),
  which is an X protocol compressor designed to improve the speed of X 
  applications run over low-bandwidth links. This functionality depends on
  JDxpc, which is a re-implementation of dxpc in pure Java.
- fixed a bug in replying to the GetAtomName request.
  This bug had prevented WeirdX working with dxpc. 
  Many thanks to Marcus Schiesser, who reported this glitch.
- fixed bugs in processing the 'ClearArea' request. Some X apps depend on
  this request in rendering pixmaps. For example, WindowMaker uses this
  request in rendering backgrounds of title-bars and menus.

	
Changes since version 1.0.19:
............................
- added the support for 'fontspecific' fonts. Try,
    xfd -fn -adobe-symbol-medium-r-normal--16-0-0-0-p-0-adobe-fontspecific
  Some X apps(for example, Lyx) rely on those fonts.
- fixed a bug in putting the bitmap(depth-1 pixmap) on the depth-16 pixmap.

	
Changes since version 1.0.18:
............................
- modified to use the 'java.awt.FontMetric.charsWidth' method instead of
  the 'java.awt.FontMetric.bytesWidth' method for running WeirdX on MacOS X.
- added the property 'weirdx.display.copypaste' for enabling/disabling
  the copy/paste functionality. At present, Java2 on MacOS X does not support
  the clipboard mechanism and the copy/paste functionality does not work.
Many thanks to Kevin Hendricks(khendricks at ivey dot uwo dot ca). Above hacks have been based on his reports.
- added the 'indirect' mode in XDMCP.
  By this hack, the 'chooser' will be available on WeirdX.
	

Changes since version 1.0.17:
............................
- fixed a glitch, 'top most part of the window is covered by the titlebar'.
- fixed a bug in displaying Korean and Chinese characters.
- fixed a critical bug in the multi-window mode.
  This bug had crashed X clients in processing the 'ReparentWindow' request.

	
Changes since version 1.0.16:
............................
- added an authorization support defined in XDMCP.
  By this hack, 'gdm' will run on WeirdX.
- fixed a bug in keymap setting reported by <Jerrad.Pierce at networkengines dot com>.
- added 'misc/twmrc' from Valentin Pavlov<v_valchev at prosyst dot bg>. He says,
  'I created this rc for use with weirdx xserver which is a little buggy..
   so i put f.refresh in "move-to-raise" function which is save to remove
   when twm is used with another xserver.'
- changed starting up procedures according to Valentin Pavlov's advice.
  You can start up weirdx very simply; 'java -jar weirdx.jar'
- added a perl script 'misc/keymap/genkeymap.pl', which generates
  java files for supporting unsupported keyboards. This script is based on
  Marcus Schiesser's script.

	
Changes since version 1.0.15:
............................
- improved to be free from the Swing API.
- fixed a bug in displaying Latin characters. Try 'xfd -fn fixed'.
- improved to detect the ALT_GRAPH key typing.
- added classes for German keyboard keymaping. 
  Try to set a property 'weirdx.display.keymap' as 'de'.
The above works were mostly done by 
  Marcus Schiesser<marcus.schiesser at student dot uni-tuebingen dot de>
and the rest were not done without his cooperations.

	
Changes since version 1.0.14:
............................
- added the XJS extension for WeirdX.
  This extension is written by Christian Werner<Christian.Werner at t-online dot de>
  and enable you to use the JavaScriptTM engine from X clients.
